Slack notification action that just works

## Introduction

I've attempted to use a few of the Slack notification actions that are currently available, but they all seem to have limitations or be quite verbose, so I set out to create a simple yet effective action that just does what you need and nothing else. In the examples below, I'll show a few different variations of how the action could be used.

The main features are:
- Status based messages meaning one step handles job successes, failures, and cancellations
- JavaScript strings for embedding environment variables or custom logic into notification strings
- Easy to add fields based on standard Slack JSON inputs

Be sure that you set the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable, either in the job or in the step.

## Example usage

The simplest use would consist of relying on the webhook's defaults and simply providing some text.

```
- name: Simple notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    text: 'This is the simplest notification'
```

Overriding the channel is sometimes needed, such as to separate out builds, deployments, and alerts perhaps.

```
- name: Channel specific notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#alerts'
    text: 'Something is happening and someone should probably panic'
```

The above works well, but what would really make someone panic is if we make the alert red, right?

You can use `danger`, `warning`, `good`, or a hex code such as `#d90000`.

```
- name: Panic inducing notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#alerts'
    text: 'Something is happening and someone should probably panic'
    color: 'danger'
```

Perhaps you also want to change the username?

```
- name: Panic Bot notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#alerts'
    username: 'Panic Bot'
    text: 'Something is happening and someone should probably panic'
    color: 'danger'
```

The action also supports fields, but due to the limitations of GitHub actions only passing in inputs as strings, we can't use yaml arrays. So, this is how you'd specify a field:

```
- name: Specifying what to panic about notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#alerts'
    username: 'Panic Bot'
    text: 'Something is happening and someone should probably panic'
    color: 'danger'
    fields: |
      [{ "title": "Reason to panic", "value": "Deployed failed halfway through" }]
```

If there were multiple reasons to panic, you'd add more objects to the fields array:

```
- name: Specifying what to panic about notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#alerts'
    username: 'Panic Bot'
    text: 'Something is happening and someone should probably panic'
    color: 'danger'
    fields: |
      [{ "title": "Reason to panic", "value": "Deployed failed halfway through", "short": true },
       { "title": "Timestamp", "value": "${Date.now()}", "short": true }]
```

Did you notice that some JavaScript snook in? Input strings are evaluated as a JavaScript strings, which means you can put environment variables into your messages, such as the `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` variable or `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` etc. The environment is stored within the `env` variable so to access environment variables in your strings, you simply use `${env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}` etc. Here's an example:

```
- name: Environment variable notification
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#example'
    text: '${env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW} (${env.GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}) has finished'
    fields: |
      [{ "title": "Repository", "value": "${env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}", "short": true },
       { "title": "Branch", "value": "${env.BRANCH}", "short": true }]
```

Now, each job has a status, which can be `success`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. Most other notification plugins use multiple blocks with `if: success()` and `if: failed()` etc but we don't need to do that. We can simply pass in the status and set status specific text. We use `if: always()` so that it runs regardless of whether the job is successful or not.

```
- name: Build notification
  if: always()
  uses: edge/simple-slack-notify@master
  with:
    channel: '#builds'
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    success_text: '${env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW} (${env.GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}) build completed successfully'
    failure_text: '${env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW} (${env.GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}) build failed'
    cancelled_text: '${env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW} (${env.GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER}) build was cancelled'
    fields: |
      [{ "title": "Repository", "value": "${env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}", "short": true },
       { "title": "Branch", "value": "${env.BRANCH}", "short": true }]
```

There are likely other ways you can use this action, so please submit a pull request if you want to add your useful example to this list. I hope this is as useful for you as it is for me.


### Extracting GitHub branch

Note: the `BRANCH` variable isn't standard. To get that, use the following:

```
- name: Extract branch name
  shell: bash
  run: echo "::set-env name=BRANCH::$(echo ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/} | sed 's/\//_/g')"
```

This won't work for actions initiated by a pull request though.

### Link to run

If you want to link to the run, that's super easy. Just add the following string either to a field or to the message.

```
${env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL}/${env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/runs/${env.GITHUB_RUN_ID}
```

So for a field you'd have:

```
{ "title": "Action URL", "value": "${env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL}/${env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/runs/${env.GITHUB_RUN_ID}"}
```

## Inputs

| Input | Details | Example/possible values |
|:------|:--------|:------------------------|
| cancelled_text | The message to send if status is cancelled | |
| channel | The channel you want to send to | #general |
| color | The color you want to use | "good", "danger", "warning" or a hex code |
| failure_text | The message to send if status is failure | |
| fields | JSON string containing an array of fields to attach to the notification | |
| status | Pass the job status through and omit color for status based color | |
| success_text | The message to send if status is success | |
| text | The message that you want to send regardless of status | |
| username | Used to override the default username | |
